*Go report card has no idea how to handle Go 1.18.* 😀

* [QStack](qstack_test.go)
* [Node](node_test.go)
* [Tree](tree_test.go)
* [Text Sets](set/text/set)

All structures make judicious use of generics and implement the same
json.AsJSON interface (and others) making them much more consumable and
shareable.

## Design Decisions

* **Why no linked-list or queue?** Because they are fulfilled by QStack
  and Node.

* **Decided to drop async walks of Node.** It's easily accomplished by
  enclosing whatever channel is needed in the iterator function and
  forking a goroutine off from within it.

## TODO

* Add equivalent methods to Node from JavaScript (InsertAfter, etc.)
* Add Union and other set methods
